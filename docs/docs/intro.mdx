# Introduction

## What is Launchkit?

Launchkit helps you bootstrap your SaaS application by providing you with a set of pre-built components that you can use to build your application.

It comes with a CLI tool that you can use to generate a new project and a set of boilerplate code that you can use to get started.

### Features

- **Authentication**: pre-built authentication system that you can use to authenticate your users.
- **Billing**: pre-built billing system that you can use to charge your users.
- **Dashboard**: pre-built dashboard that you can use to manage your application.
- **Settings**: pre-built settings page that you can use to manage your application settings.

## Why Launchkit?

When building your next Saas application, you want to focus on building your product and not on building the same boilerplate code that every Saas application needs.

So, focus on building your product and let Launchkit handle the boilerplate code for you.
