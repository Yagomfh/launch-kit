# Getting Started

First of all, you'll need a backend and a frontend to start building your application:

```bash
npx launchkit-cli@latest init
```

## Start your backend and frontend:

```bash
cd [your-app-name]/apps/api
yarn
yarn develop
```

```bash
cd [your-app-name]/apps/web
yarn
yarn dev
```
