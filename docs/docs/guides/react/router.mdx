# Router

The `Router` component is used to define the routes in your application. It is a wrapper around the `react-router-dom` `BrowserRouter` component and uses the `Route` component to define the routes.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Router } from "react-launchkit";

function App() {
  return (
    <Router
      routes={[
        {
          path: "/",
          component: <div>Home</div>,
          access: "public",
        },
        {
          path: "/login",
          component: <div>Login</div>,
          access: "public",
        },
        {
          path: "/dashboard",
          component: <div>Dashboard</div>,
          access: "private",
        }
      ]}
    />
  );
}
```


:::warning
The `Router` component must be wrapped in the `LaunchKitProvider` component. See the [Quick Start](/docs/guides/react/quick-start#set-up-the-launchkitprovider-and-router) guide for more information.
